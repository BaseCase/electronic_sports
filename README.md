A new PuzzleScript game!! Work in progress for now. Will fill out this README as there's more to say.


## Ideas to try out
* tackling other player
* dribbling skills (walk into ball to displace it?)
* action button kicks depending on your position
* play with number of moves
* play with court and goal size
* draw lines on the court for visual coolness
* obstacles? different courts? you could do this by walking between rooms and game starts when you sit on the start square in a court
* play around with goal...do you kick it just into the goal square, or past it?
