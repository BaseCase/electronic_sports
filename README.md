A new PuzzleScript game!! Work in progress for now. Will fill out this README as there's more to say.


## Ideas to try out
* Can I consolidate some of the rules that are duplicated between Player and Player2 with an alias?
* tackling other player
* play with number of moves
* play with court and goal size
* play with kicking mechanics
* draw lines on the court for visual coolness
* obstacles? different courts? you could do this by walking between rooms and game starts when you sit on the start square in a court
* special move where a player can drop obstacles in the way of each other?
* background youtube: soccer game crowd noises
* multiple peeps (with different abilities?) on each side
* maybe only one move and then switch sides?
